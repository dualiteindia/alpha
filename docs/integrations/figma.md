You'll be redirected to an oAuth screen. Make sure the oAuth account (singhvirohan01@gmail.com in my case) is the same where your Figma file is in.

### Selecting the Figma design URL

On successful authentication, you'll be redirected to this screen.

Make sure you select the Figma design URL, preferably a Frame, Component or Instance.&#x20;

Here's how you do that:

* Open the Figma design file
* Select the Frame you want to convert
* Right Click on the design
* Select Copy/Paste as
* Select Copy link to selection
* Paste the copied URL in Alpha the field above and click on "Import"

You can reconfirm the same as Alpha will show you. Click on "Continue with this Design" once you're sure for the same. Once clicked, you'll be able to see the "Figma green tick" as a confirmation at the chat bot

You can then type out in the message any additional details or simply _"Build this Dashboard based off the Figma file"_
