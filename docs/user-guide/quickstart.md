### Getting started

* Prompting: Just describe what you want to build in the prompt box. The more specific you are, the better the results. Start with clear and detailed prompts. You can refine and adjust your project as you go. Example: “Create a wedding event management platform with Kanban and financial tracker.”
* Templates: Alpha provides templates for quick setup on popular projects like dashboards, e-commerce sites, and social apps. Once a template loads, use prompts to customise features, add new elements, or refine the design to fit your vision.
* Using Figma: Simply select the Import from Figma button, copy the Figma URL. Dualite will be then able to convert that Figma design to code. Read more on this [here](../integrations/figma.md)
* Integrating APIs: You can integrate REST APIs by either copy-pasting your OpenAI specification or we can build a dummy API for you. Read more on this [here](../integrations/apis.md)
* References and Screenshots: You can add screenshots and paper-pen based mock-ups to start off&#x20;

### Iterative chat

After describing what you want to build at first, you can keep iterative and developing on top of it through the iterative chat functionality.

You can keep on building on top with concise prompts and adding context like Figma designs or screenshots for the "next" screen, or integrating API post generation of the UI

You can modify code through two ways:

* Manually: you can directly edit the code in the specific file you want to change right in the editor, and click on "Save"
* Prompting: You can type in the Iterative Chat on what needs to be modified.&#x20;

### Terminal

You can also access the terminal in the code editor by clicking on the terminal icon at the top right icon in the code editor. You can use this for commands like _npm run dev_ or _npm install_

### Using the code: Deployment and Download

You can download the code as ZIP or deploy with Netlify, whatever you seem fit.&#x20;
