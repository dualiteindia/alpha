# Quickstart

&#x20;Let's build a finance dashboard for CEOs to manage their company data on React + TW !

### TLDR

### Access Link

After you've signed up for the [waitlist](https://www.dualite.dev/waitlist), you'll receive an email something like this with the Access link. You need to click on that link to start using Alpha

### Put in a prompt

You'll be directed to a screen like this. Let's choose the default React and Tailwind setting with TypeScript. You can then directly prompt in the message box "Generate a finance dashboard for CEOs to manage their company data"

### Have some patience

Once you hit the blue button (or click on Enter), please wait sometime. It usually takes a minute or two to load.

The Code Toggle at the top will automatically shift to Preview once the whole process is done. The three dots in the Chat section is also a great indicator that Alpha is building. Once it stops, that means the process is done.

### See the preview, and keep on building!

The Preview will show you the final output. You can also keep on building by chatting at the bottom-right. I'm prompting it to add a dark mode on this dashboard.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can refer on how you can prompt better by reading this [guide](../prompt-techniques/prompt-techniques.md)

### One more thing: deployment ðŸš€

You can directly deploy the product by clicking on the top-right icon and connecting your account with Netlify

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also download the code as ZIP. Here's our project's deployed link though, check it out [here](https://finance-dashboard-for-ceos-zx51cz-alphaproject.netlify.app/analytics)
