# APIs

Dualite has a unique functionality of integrating REST APIs. There are two ways:

* Infer API automatically: Dualite builds out a 'dummy' API for you based on inferring the frontend structure to get you an idea of how the API needs to be developed
* OpenAPI spec: You can directly copy-paste your API Swagger doc or OpenAPI spec and it'll automatically understand which API endpoint needs to be connected to which design element
